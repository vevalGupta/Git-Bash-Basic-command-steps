3.Branches
-when many developers work on a single repository ,we use git branch
-each developer is design a branch to fill their work without disturbing our devepolers 's code.
-developer can merge two or more branches into one main branch
                Command in branches:  
a) git branch - to check the current branch we are working on.
b) git branch -m name(main)- to rename the current  branch.
c) git checkout branch_name - to changes current branch to another branch
d) git branch -b new_branch_name =to create a new branch
e) git branch -d branch_name - to delete the branch
merge the Two branch
    /          \
    Git bash    Github
1) git dff branch_name - to see the comparison between branches
2) git merge branch_name - to merge branch with the main branch
Github
-by creating a PR(pull request)
Pull Request-Pull Request (PR) is a feature used to propose changes from one branch to another.
It is mainly used when working in teams.

4)undoing changes
Case I: staged changes ( after add .)
-for undo the changes in few files -(git reset file_name)
-for undo the changes in many file -(git reset)
Case II: commit changes( after commit -m)
-we have remove one changes from head (where last commit change is stored)-(git reset HEAD~1)
-for undo many committed changes we use-(git reset hash_code)
log screen contain the hash_code
hash_code = every committed change have a specific hash value, we copy it 
-to show reset changes in local repository we use , -(git reset -- hard hash_code)
